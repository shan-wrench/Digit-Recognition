# Digit-Recognition
This repository contains the implementation of a digit recognition system using machine learning techniques. The project is designed to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) by training a model on the popular MNIST dataset.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and reshaping of images to ensure consistency.
Model Training: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy in digit recognition.
Evaluation: Provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Includes visualizations of training progress and sample predictions.

# Requirements
Python 3.12
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
